# Preprocessing
The scripts in this folder perform the preprocessing necessary 
to conduct the analysis for brain age prediction.

This includes: 
- cleaning data and removing subjects with incomplete information,
- quality control of raw and segmented data, 
- compute preprocessed kernels for the voxel data,
- perform dimensionality reduction for the voxel data using PCA
