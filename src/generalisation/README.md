# Measuring the generalization of trained regressors

The scripts in this folder are used to test the generalization performance of 
the models trained in the scripts in the 'comparison' subdirectory. This means
that the models are applied to a new, independent dataset that was acquired 
on a different MRI scanner.

Measuring generalization performance in an independent dataset eliminates 
sample bias from the performance measures, and it provides a more realistic
representation of brain age as a biomarker in clinical practice or the like.
