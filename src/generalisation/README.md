# Measuring the generalization of trained regressors

The scripts in this folder are responsible for testing the models previously trained on a dataset of a different scanner, to measure how well do the results generalize between scanners. The measured models were the voxel data SVM, FreeSurfer SVM, voxel data RVM and Freesurfer RVM.
