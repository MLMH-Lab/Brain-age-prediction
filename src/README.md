In this directory, we stored all the script files used in our analysis.
These scripts were divided into subdirectories according to their main 
functionality:

1. [Comparison between machine learning methods](comparison)
2. [Measuring the generalization of trained regressors](generalisation) 
3. [Performance of models by the size of training set](sample_size)
