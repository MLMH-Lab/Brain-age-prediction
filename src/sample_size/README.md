# Performance of models by the size of training set
This folder includes the scripts to perform the analysis of the 
impact of the sample size of the training set for brain age prediction.

The scripts use bootstrapping to assess the robustness of performance and
determine the minimum training set size required for model performance 
above chance level. Performance is measured in terms of the model's
mean absolute error (MAE).
